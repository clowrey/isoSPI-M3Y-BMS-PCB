## ⚡ Overview

This PCB design implements a complete BMS controller capable of:

- **Direct BMB Communication**: isoSPI master interface for Battery Management Boards
- **High Precision Monitoring**: Current, voltage, temperature, and power measurement
- **CAN Bus Integration**: 500kbps communication with vehicle systems and inverters
- **Contactor Control**: Safe sequenced activation of high-voltage contactors
- **Cell Balancing**: Individual cell balancing control through BMB modules
- **Safety Features**: Overcurrent, overvoltage, undervoltage, and thermal protection

### 🔋 Tesla Model 3/Y Battery Pack Architecture

Tesla Model 3 and Model Y battery packs utilize a modular architecture:

- **Cell Configuration:** 4416 cells (96s46p) in 4 modules
- **Module Configuration:** 24 cells in series per module (96 total series groups)
- **Nominal Voltage:** ~350V (fully charged: ~400V, discharged: ~280V)
- **Capacity:** Varies by pack (50-82 kWh depending on model/year)
- **Battery Management Boards (BMBs):** Each module contains BMBs that monitor cell groups
- **Communication:** Original packs use proprietary Tesla BMS; this project replaces it

**Why Replace the BMS?**
- Reuse Tesla packs in DIY electric vehicle conversions

## 🔧 Utility Scripts

### `reassociate_components.py`

Re-links PCB footprints to schematic symbols after copying design sections. This is essential when:
- Copying and pasting PCB sections (breaks UUID links)
- Duplicating circuits for multi-channel designs
- Recovering from schematic/PCB desynchronization

**Usage:**
```bash
python reassociate_components.py
```

The script:
1. Parses both `.kicad_sch` and `.kicad_pcb` files
2. Matches components by reference designator and type
3. Updates PCB footprints with correct schematic UUIDs
4. Creates backup before modification

### `apply_mapping.py`

Applies specific component reference remapping (e.g., when renaming U11→U27). Updates both reference designators and UUID linkages.

**Usage:**
```bash
python apply_mapping.py
```
